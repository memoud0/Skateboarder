# Skateboarding Travel App

## Overview
This web application is designed to enhance the urban skateboarding experience by calculating skateboard travel times and displaying nearby skateparks. It uses the **Mapbox API** to provide real-time mapping, route calculations, and markers for local skateparks, allowing users to easily navigate to skateparks from their current location.

## Features
- **Mapbox API Integration**: Displays a fully interactive map centered on the user’s current location.
- **Skatepark Markers**: Skateparks are marked on the map, and users can click the markers to view information.
- **Route Calculation**: When a skatepark marker is clicked, the app calculates and displays the route from the user’s current location to the skatepark with an estimated travel time.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: For building the UI components and managing state.
- **Mapbox GL JS**: For map rendering and interactive features.
- **Mapbox Directions API**: For route calculation.
- **Geolocation API**: To find the user’s current location.
